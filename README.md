# Waterway

Factorio mod
 
This mod allows the placement of water just like landfill.

Research the tech to unlock.

All credits go to ceryss & Riley19280 & untraceablesmurf - I just forked their mod for a different texture.
Original fork:

Just adds 1 iron 1 stone and a bit more water to the recipe.
